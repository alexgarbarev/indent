## 1.0.0+2

* "performance improvements" - replace `List.generate(indentationLevel)` with a `StringBuffer` and a for loop. Nobody will probably notice the difference, but go ahead and enjoy the performance improvement of a couple Planck times anyway.

## 1.0.0+1

* Somebody accidentally forgot to change the default package description. That's now fixed.

## 1.0.0

* Initial version
